# Live edits

Collaborate on pages in real-time with your teammates

**Live editing** is the default editing mode for any newly-created GitBook space. A space in live edit mode is editable by anyone with the <Button variant="link" colorScheme="teal"><Link to="/">right permissions</Link></Button>.

With live editing enabled, you can see the avatars of anyone currently viewing the space in the top-right corner.

GitBook supports live collaboration, meaning youâ€™ll be able to work on the same document with multiple members at the same time.
